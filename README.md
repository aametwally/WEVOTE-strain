# WEVOTE2
Extension of WEVOTE algorithm to identify for microbes on strain level
This is currently a work in progress - current plans for developing the software are as follows:
1. Evaluate CAMI datasets against a pan-species database (WEVOTEdb)
2. Implement a strain level database generated from representative strains for E.Coli
3. Generate scripts for assessing validity and precision of strain level classification under the E.Coli database
4. Develop a pipeline in order to run WEVOTE at species level followed by WEVOTE at the species level concurrently
